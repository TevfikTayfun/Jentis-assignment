QUESTIONS;

1. I am going to answer this question like it is the beginning of a big project.
I believe getting the know the entire project is important and we can only see a fragment of it.
Small document about the complete picture of the project might've been helpful.
Other than that not the document but small talk with the Project Manager and getting feedback could make the testing much more efficient.
The given information is enough to do a basic regression.

2. Hierarchy is very important in a project like this.
Since every part of those endpoints are related to each other one way or the other we gotta make sure it works perfectly in every step starting with SIGN UP and LOGIN. Without these two other endpoints have no meaning or function.
I'd like to group these identification in order.

AUTHENTICATION
 * SIGN UP (Add user)
 * LOGIN
 * LOGOUT
USERS
 * Updating User
 * Deleting User
CONTACT
 * Adding Contact
 * Updating Contact
 * Deleting Contact

Before every single part and I would just browse around our website and check the necessary parts by hand before working with the automation if I have time. Simple manual testing and checking the site gives me a better idea to prepare and run cases.
* For Authentication part I would control every single outcome I have written on backend cases as well. I believe this is the most important part of all since it is the gateway to our product. Functional testing and Regression testing are a must in this category. And I believe this is the most important part.
* For users I would create and update the simple user and do functional testing alongside. Automation regression testing should check every mandatory option that user has to enter.
* Same with user rest of the contact tests are similar. Basic regression testing and functionality testing should be enough.
